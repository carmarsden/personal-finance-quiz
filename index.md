# Wireframes for Bloc Quiz App:

As this quiz app will show different information on the DOM based on user input, I have set up four different wireframes for the different types of screen user will encounter:
1. Quiz Welcome Screen: https://carmarsden.github.io/bloc-quiz-app/wireframe1.html
2. Quiz Question Screen: https://carmarsden.github.io/bloc-quiz-app/wireframe2.html
3. Quiz Answer Screen: https://carmarsden.github.io/bloc-quiz-app/wireframe3.html
4. Quiz Final Results Screen: https://carmarsden.github.io/bloc-quiz-app/wireframe4.html
