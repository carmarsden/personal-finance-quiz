# Wireframes for Bloc Quiz App:

As this quiz app will show different information on the DOM based on user input, I have set up four basic greybox wireframes for the different types of screen user will encounter:
1. [Quiz Welcome Screen](https://carmarsden.github.io/bloc-quiz-app/wireframe1.html)
2. [Quiz Question Screen](https://carmarsden.github.io/bloc-quiz-app/wireframe2.html)
3. [Quiz Answer Screen](https://carmarsden.github.io/bloc-quiz-app/wireframe3.html)
4. [Quiz Final Results Screen](https://carmarsden.github.io/bloc-quiz-app/wireframe4.html)
